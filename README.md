# Relational Schema Database
This project automates the SQL fetching process from a JDBC Oracle server. Users can enter options at the CLI to retrieve specific details about a student's information. 
Using protected Oracle JDBC driver statements, the users input is placed into preformatted queries that are then retrieved and displayed to the user in a table format in the CLI.
## Relationships
This program ensures to represent relationships between elements. For example, the relationship between 'Enrolled In' and 'Student', 'Section' and 'Instructor', 'Course' and 
'Department', etc. Primary keys, foreign keys, and attribute constraints are also accounted for when adding to database.
The diagram showing relationships is attached and displays the entity relationships between objects.
